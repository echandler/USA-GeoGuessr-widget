# USA GeoGuessr widget
Interactive USA map widget for GeoGuessr.com

### How to use:
1. Install greasemokey or tampermonkey.
2. Create a new script and delete the default contents.
3. Copy everything in src.js to the new script.
4. Save and reload GeoGuessr.com.

### Instructions:

* Move widget: Hover pointer over the USA widget, hold the left mouse button down and drag it around.
* Resize widget: Hover the pointer over the USA widget and rotate the scroll wheel on your mouse, easy peezy.
* Toggle state color: Click on the state with left mouse button.

Disclaimer: The free geolocation service that the extension uses has a hard time with locations next to borders, especially in rural locations. If it doesn't highlight the state automatically the player would need to click on the map manually to select it. Also, the code depends on the GeoGuessr source code, which I have no control over, so if the Geoguessr code changes it could break this script. If it stops working for some reason check back and see if the code has been updated.
